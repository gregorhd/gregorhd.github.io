# About me

I'm an urban planner and python/GIS specialist with experience in preparing and implementing urban infrastructure projects covering, among others, social housing, urban transport, and WASH in South and South-East Asia (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank). In addition, I have provided policy advice on solid waste management (World Bank) and affordable housing/resource efficiency in buildings (UN-Habitat HQ and Delhi Office). I also hold a PGDip in Public Financial Management (SOAS, University of London).
